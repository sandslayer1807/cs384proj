=========

Class project for CS 384, which consists of:

Two towns A and B are connected with a bridge. Suppose there are four
people and their moving directions are indicated by the arrows. The bridge is narrow, and at any
time, multiple people cannot pass in the opposite directions.

1. Based on the Ricart & Agrawalas mutual exclusion algorithm, design a decentralized protocol
so that at most one person can be on the bridge at any given time, and no person is indeﬁnitely
prevented from crossing the bridge. Treat each person to be a process, and assume that their
clocks are synchronized.

2. Design another protocol so that multiple people can be on the bridge as long as they are
moving in the same direction, but no person is indeﬁnitely prevented from crossing the bridge.
Design a graphical user interface to display the movement of the people, so that the instructor can
control the walking speed of the people and verify the protocol. Note that to receive full credits,
you should provide instructions on how to compile and run your program, and your program should
be well-documented.
